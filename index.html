					<p>Based on <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's Fireside Chat</a>, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?

					Talk about what came up for you and anything you want in addition to the questions above.</p>

					<p>I've never been too great at CSS, but I'm pretty proud of what I've put together here - it's amazing what a non-standard font and a nice background image can do!</p></span>
