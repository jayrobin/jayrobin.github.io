						<a href="http://www.reddit.com"><h3>reddit</h3></a>
						<p>reddit is one of my favorite websites primarily because it is a hugely customizable experience. While the front page may look like nothing more than cat pictures and stupid jokes to a new user, registered users can subscribe to any of thousands of diverse communities to create their own unique feed of new content.</p>

						<br/>
						<p>On first glance, my eye is drawn to the column of posts down the page.</p>

						<br/>
						<p>I would describe the design of the website as: simple, functional and un-intrusive</p>

						<br/>
						<p>This website has a wide array of content: scientific articles, fail videos, programming tutorials, political debates, recipes, pornography, and everything in-between. However, to a new user the juxtaposition of both serious and non-serious content could be described as 'confusing'.</p>

						<br/>
						<p>The existence of subreddits and therefore the navigation through non front-page content is not immediately obvious to non-users. Even for registered users, the task of finding new and interesting subreddits is an incredibly difficult one that relies almost entirely on being linked to them by other users.</p>

						<br/>
						<p>How I feel after browsing the site depends entirely on what subreddits I have subscribed to: after browsing the default front-page, I certainly feel like I have wasted a lot of time. However, after browsing some of my subscribed subreddits (e.g. ruby, rails, programming, getdisciplined), I feel fairly 'informed' (but still that my time could have been better spent elsewhere!).</p>

						<br/>
						<p>As well as advertisements, the site also generates revenue via 'reddit gold'. Users can purchase gold and gift it to other users for interesting links or comments. It serves no practical purpose (beyond the giftee gaining temporary access to a 'gold' subreddit), but has proven popular as a method of 'super upvoting' content.</p>

						<br/>
						<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk"><h3>Amazon.co.uk</h3></a>
						<p>I do almost all of my non-grocery shopping on Amazon because I can be almost certain that it will have exactly what I need on it, and I can get free next-day delivery via Amazon Prime.</p>

						<br/>
						<p>The eye is immediately drawn to the large offer carousel immediately below the search box.</p>

						<br/>
						<p>I would describe the design of the website as: cluttered.</p>

						<br/>
						<p>This website serves to offer a huge selection of goods for sale online to compete with high-street retailers. It allows users to browse from their own home on their own time, and read detailed reviews from others users in order to be better informed about their purchases.</p>

						<br/>
						<p>The content of this website is the products themselves, which I would therefore describe as 'diverse'.</p>

						<br/>
						<p>Though the site feels reasonably cluttered, the search box is quite prominently displayed at the top of the page and functions very well. It is therefore quite straightforward to find what you are looking for. The main issue arises when trying to simply 'browse' without a specific item in mind, since the categorization of items can sometimes be confusing.</p>

						<br/>
						<p>If I go onto the site with a purchase in mind, then I usually feel quite satisfied after browsing, since the process is incredibly streamlined (e.g. one-click purchases) and I can be confident in my purchase thanks to user reviews and ratings.</p>

						<br/>
						<p>As a shopping site, the revenue is driven entirely by products sold. I made my first purchase from Amazon in 2003 and have now reached a point where I buy nearly all items from the site (having free next-day delivery is a large driving factor of this).</p>

						<br/>
						<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk"><h3>BBC News</h3></a>
						<p>I like BBC News in general for impartiality, but I particularly love their website.</p>

						<br/>
						<p>The top left news story is most prominently visible thanks to a bolder headline than the following stories.</p>

						<br/>
						<p>I would describe the design of the website as: well-suited, in that it fits the ethos of the BBC very well (clear, concise, and as factful as possible).</p>

						<br/>
						<p>This website is a publicly funded news site which, like other online news sites, is designed to offer up-to-the minute updates on breaking news stories.</p>

						<br/>
						<p>The content of this website is news stories (both textual and video) and other relevant articles (e.g. opinion pieces).</p>

						<br/>
						<p>At first glance the site seems fairly cluttered, but it actually follows a fairly logical flow: the left column is composed of main articles, declining in importance/popularity down the page, while the right column is other non-news features, stories and opinion pieces. Further down the page are categorised stories and 'most read' links, the latter of which I feel may be better placed in a more prominent position.</p>

						<br/>
						<p>After browsing BBC News I generally feel 'informed' - the articles are usually very purposeful and relevant to current affairs (i.e. in comparison to other news sites, there are far fewer 'fluff pieces').</p>

						<br/>
						<p>BBC News is a publicly funded website and therefore contains no advertisements, which I believe greatly enhances the site experience.</p>
