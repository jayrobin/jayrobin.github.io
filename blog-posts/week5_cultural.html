					<h3>Week Four - Cultural blog</h3>
					<span class="article_content">
						<p>03 Jul 2014</p>
						<h4></h4>
						Desktop Tower Defense released
						Convinced me to try developing games
						Released first game, not much feedback
						Released X games since then
						Had some great feedback
						Examples of bad feedback
						Built up a thick skin when it comes to feedback?
						Also became good at giving feedback
						Hired by FGL to give feedback
						Assumed I was good at giving direct feedback

						Joined DBC, thought I would be fine with giving/receiving feedback

						Was uncertain about pairing - I'm used to solving things on my own and don't have a logical process

						First pairing sessions went well


						Pairing:

What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?
Was something particularly fun or rewarding?
Was something frustrating and difficult for you?
Feedback

How did you feel when you read your feedback?
Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?
Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?
How was it to write feedback?
What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?
Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?
