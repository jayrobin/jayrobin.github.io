						<h4>Thoughts on feedback and pair programming</h4>
						<p>In 2007, a Flash game called Desktop Tower Defense was released and became wildly popular. At the time, I was looking for a new hobby project and, after reading about the amount of money Desktop Tower Defense had made after being built by one amateur programmer in his spare time, I was set on making my riches with the next great web game.</p>

						<p>My first attempt was pretty embarassing, looking back - an extended clone of the 1979 Lunar Lander game for the Atari. However, I did take a good approach of building an MVP and then iterating it with feedback from players. Unfortunately, since I didn't really know how to reach a decent sized playerbase, my players were family and friends, who did give me good feedback which was almost certainly quite sugarcoated.</p>

						<p>I kept developing games on and off since that time, releasing over a dozen small games over the years, racking up a combined total of roughly 20 million plays (the vast majority of which came from my three most popular titles). With the popular games, I obviously received a lot more feedback - some good, some bad. However, I made a point of keeping my emotion out of it and taking the constuctive points from all feedback. This wasn't always an easy task - I could deal with negativity and 'mean' comments, but some would be pure vitriol peppered with the occasional death threat (yes I did once get death threats after releasing a free game - apparently he thought the 'hard' mode was too hard). Regardless, over the years I like to think I became quite good at receiving feedback - I know personally of other game developers who literally cannot bring themselves to read any feedback, for fear of it being negative, or that get incredibly defensive (understandable when they've worked tirelessly to produce it).</p>

						<img src='#' alt='feedback' />

						<p>In around 2009 when I was most involved in developing Flash games, I also became very good at <em>giving</em> feedback. Since I knew how hard it was to get good feedback from players, I'd make an effort to review games very thoroughly and provide detailed, neutral feedback to game developers. Eventually, I was hired by the biggest Flash and mobile game licensor to review games for their clients.</p>

						<p>When I started the process of applying to DBC I did a lot of reading up on the process from any blogs or articles I could find. When I read about pair programming and the requirement to provide and receive feedback from other students, I figured I would have no problem with this as I had a lot of experience in giving feedback to others, and a fairly thick skin thanks to several years worth of feedback from some very entitled gamers.</p>

						<p>My first pairing session went well - it seemed as though we both had a similar understanding of HTML and CSS, so we completed the challenge without too many problems, but at the same time I was a little uncomfortable with the very different way of working than what I was used to. I have been programming in some form or another for as long as I can remember, and always on my own, so I had become very used to working in my head and in my own way - to suddenly have to program while verbalizing my thought process, or being navigated by someone else while wanting to shoot off in some other direction took a lot of getting used to.</p>

						<p>The actual pairing session wasn't the most difficult part, however. When it came to writing the feedback for the session my mind went completely blank - I knew exactly what I wanted to say but I couldn't think of a way to say it. When giving feedback to game developers in the past they were always random usernames and avatars on some forum that I'd never meet, but suddenly I was giving feedback to a very real person who I'd be meeting in just a few months. What if they knew it was me who gave them this feedback and took something I said personally? Would that sour our relationship at DBC and make it difficult to ever pair together again?</p>

						<p>I'd like to say I dealt with my issue there and then, pushing my anxieties aside and doing what I was tasked to do - giving Actionable, Kind, Specific feedback to a fellow student. The truth is that I really tried (I probably spent longer on that first piece of feedback than I did on the challenge itself), but reading it back again now it's obvious to me that I sugar-coated it, I left bits out I thought they wouldn't like reading, and at the end of the day I didn't do them nor me any favours.</p>

						<p>Receiving feedback was a little easier - I could sometimes tell other students were giving me the same sugar-coated feedback as I was dishing out, but often I could pick out the 'real' feedback underneath and learn a little something about myself, even if it was initially hard to hear...or read.</p>

						<p>I've now racked up a respectable number of pair programming hours and am definitely starting to see the benefit - I've got a long way to go, but I'm a lot more comfortable saying what I'm thinking when trying to work out an approach in my head, as well as driving and not being tempted to start playing around with the code without instruction. As for giving feedback, I still probably overthink it far too much, but it's getting a little easier each time. I've been using my 'meta-feedback' scores as a yardstick of my own performance in writing good feedback and it seems to be rising slowly over time.</p>
