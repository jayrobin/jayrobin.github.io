					<h3>Week Eight - Cultural blog</h3>
					<span class="article_content">
						<p class='date'>25 Jul 2014</p>
						<p>Early in my career as a Project Manager, I was tasked with a particularly difficult project - another PM had left unexpectedly and someone was desperately needed to manage a project which would see the development of a new client setup system interfaced with our ancient back-end databases, and it had to be delivered in just three months, programmed by an offshore team who had yet to be engaged, and analysis/design had yet to begin.</p>
						<p>The business partner representing the end users who would be setting up clients in the system was nice enough, but had just been promoted into a new role and was therefore very difficult to get hold of. I had a lot of concerns about this project, but being a new Project Manager I saw it as a test of my abilities and that it would obviously be a sign of weakness to ask for help. However, due to the business partner's lack of engagement in the project and general lack of knowledge about the clients and end users, I had to take on a second role of Business Analyst.</p>
						<p>The project took a toll on my mental and physical health as I ended up working longer and longer weeks closer to the deadline - thankfully, my team and manager were very supportive and quick to recognise my efforts. Unfortunately, when the project finally did launch (late), the end users were unhappy with the result and resistant to implementation for quite a few months. 
						During this time, we worked closely with some of the more receptive teams to implement fixes to the system and improve the overall client setup process.</p>
						<p>Also during this time, a considerable amount of personal conflict arose between the business partner and me - not directly, but I was often forwarded very negative emails or heard second-hand about comments made regarding my performance (note that this is not to say I am not guilty of similar actions - I can definitely recall venting to a few colleagues about my experiences with the business partner). The low point came during a 1am conference call tangentially related to the project: I had not planned to attend due to the time, but at the last minute decided to jump on since I was still awake. Before long the topic of my project arose and some comments were made about a few of the negative impacts to the business. As I was mustering the courage to speak up and explain the situation, the business partner (who I did not know had attended, and who didn't know I had) began to talk, almost immediately pinning the blame for all the project failings on me and declaring they would "be having words with my manager" to the thirty or so people on the call. Due to a combination of tiredness, stress and anger, I simply hung up and went to sleep - I knew I wouldn't have been able to keep control of my temper had I have spoken up at that point.</p>
						<p>I should have spoken to my manager about the incident, but instead decided to forget about it, since the project was finally reaching a point of stability and would be closed off soon, allowing me to move onto something different. The business partner never did have words with my manager, but I did still hear about the occasional complaint or finger pointing for a little while after I'd moved on.</p>
						<p>Due to the size of the business and diversity of the projects, I never had to work with that particular person again, but the experience did always stick with me as something that I could have handled better. Looking back, the conflict was caused by a number of factors:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Business partner's inexperience in a new role</li>
							<li>My own inexperience as a Project Manager</li>
							<li>Poor handling of the project before it was handed to me</li>
							<li>Unforeseen and occasionally unavoidable obstacles in the project</li>
						</ul>
						<p>These factors led to problems with the project, which led to conflict between the business partner and myself as we were both new to our roles and therefore very keen to impress. Had the project have been successful, I have no doubt that no conflict would have ever arisen and we would both be an integral part of each-other's network.</p>
						<p>As mentioned above, once the conflict did actually arise, I was mostly interested in forgetting about it and moving - I was new to the company and the business partner was above my grade, so I didn't feel comfortable with confronting them. However, I knowing what I know now, with the experience I have and confidence in my abilities, I would definitely do a few things differently:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>I would have been more direct with them, particularly after the conference call incident, and discussed how we could move forward into a better working relationship</li>
							<li>Had it have continued, I would have escalated the situation to my manager</li>
							<li>I would have voiced my concerns about the lack of engagement with the business partner much earlier on in the project when there was still a chance it could be resolved</li>
							<li>I would have voiced my other concerns about the project with my manager, especially around my having to take on multiple project roles</li>
						</ul>

						<p>The last point is something that I learned and fixed very soon after this project - initially I'd see any issue or risk in the project as my personal responsibility to resolve or mitigate, only involving others if I really couldn't manage. The problem is, by that time it would often be too late - as a Project Manager it's my responsibility to keep everyone aware of the status of the project, and to ask for help and resources as soon as (or ideally, before) they're needed.</p>

						<p>As for workplace conflict in general, I still don't <em>like</em> it (does anyone?), but I feel that I'm far better at facing it and, more importantly, seeing it as an opportunity to learn, grow, and build better relationships - some of my most valuable business contacts are actually people who I, at one time or another, had a conflict with and was able to work through it with them.</p>
