						<p class='date'>01 Aug 2014</p>
						<p>My earliest memories of learning to program are of being sat in front of an Oric-1 copying listings character-by-character out of a telephone directory-sized reference book. It used tapes, so any time I wanted to save my progress I'd have to wait and listen to ten minutes of screeches (the volume control was broken on the tape deck we used). Looking back, I honestly don't know how I had the patience for it, but there was something amazing to little me about typing in letters and seeing graphics jump around on the screen, knowing that I'd caused it.</p>

						<p>Nowadays, with the internet, forums and free online courses, people have more information than they could ever read, watch or listen to in a lifetime, so in theory learning to program is easier than ever. However, this progress has also introduced an ever growing number of programming tools, languages, concepts, paradigms and opinions that could be quite overwhelming to someone new to programming. Questions, therefore, will always be necessary, and thankfully there are a number of great websites which offer a perfect question/answer interface: <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/'>StackOverflow</a> is one of these websites.</p>

						<p>Both questions and answers on StackOverflow can receive up and downvotes from other users based on how good/helpful they are. Since the archive of questions can be sorted by number of votes, it therefore offers a great insight into what makes a good or bad question.</p>

						<p>Take, for example, the question above, which is one of the lowest ranked questions with the 'ruby' tag. The question has a number of major issues which hinder attempts to answer it:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Not specific enough: the question is asking multiple unrelated things (what does 'is_a' do and what is an 'Integer')</li>
							<li>No detail in the question: related to the above issue, the question and title are the same. Ideally, the title should be a summary of the question and the question itself should provide necessary detail</li>
							<li>Random chunk of code thrown in: the 'prime' method seems to be what the asker is working on, but it offers no useful insight into the question</li>
							<li>Question could be easily Googled: both 'is_a?' and 'Integer' are very simple concepts in ruby - the asker clearly made no attempt to research these on his/her own first</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Due to the fundamental issues mentioned above, it would be difficult to 'improve' this question: it should at least have been split into two more specific questions each with detail around what the asker is trying to do, but more importantly the asker should have made some attempt to solve the problem on their own first.</p>

						<p>Let's compare this to a highly-ranked question in StackOverflow:</p>
						<img src='http://i.imgur.com/o0ifeDD.png' alt='good stackoverflow question' />
						<p>In this question, the asker provides a concise yet descriptive title, a clear problem statement, and an appropriate amount of code. It is also clear that they have considered other ways to solve the problem but are looking for a more optimal solution ('how do I check this without looping through?'). Though the question is quite simple, the high number of votes indicate that many others have found it useful and, in fact, the question is the top result in google for many iterations of 'ruby check if value is in array'.</p>
