						<h4>My thoughts on stereotype threat</h4>

						<p><strong>Stereotype</strong>: a widely held yet oversimplified or often entirely incorrect belief about a person based on their gender, race, religion, career, or some other attribute.</p>

						<p><strong>Stereotype threat</strong>: the fear of inadvertantly confirming those negative stereotypes.</p>

						<p>The first study into sterotype threat was carried out in 1995 by Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson<sup><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat#Original_study'>1</a></sup>: they had African-American and European-American college students take a particularly difficult test, with half of the group being told that the test would be used to determine their intellectual ability, and the other half being told that the test was merely a problem-solving task and would not be used as any kind of intellectual measure.</p>

						<img src='http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Stereotype_threat_bw.jpg' alt='results of 1995 Steele-Aronson study' class='center' />
						<p>The same test was given to all students, and the results clearly showed that black students vastly underperformed when they were under the assumption that their intelligence was being measured, while those under no such assumptions performed similarly or better compared to white students. Since that first study, many more have been carried out and over 300 papers have been published on the subject of stereotype threat.</p>

						<p>I was recently reading about women in chess and was surprised that there were so few women grandmasters: just 31 out of 1,444. For a game based on strategic, tactical and spatial thinking, it didn't make sense that there could be such a massive disparity between the genders. It turns out that this can largely be explained by the difference in the number of players of each gender: in Germany, for example, there are 120,000 known chess players, 113,000 of whom are male <sup><a href='http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2008/12/23/why-are-there-so-few-female-chess-grandmasters/'>2</a></sup>. However, I feel that this can also be highlighted as a clear example of stereotype threat: women are told they are not as good as men at chess, they are <em>encouraged</em> to participate in women-only tournaments, and women chess players who did achieve grandmaster status highlighted as miraculous exceptions to the rule.</p>

						<img src='http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02417/JuditPolgar_2417931b.jpg' alt='Judit Polgár' class='center' />

						<p>Judit Polgár, a Hungarian-born woman was raised from birth to be a chess prodigy by her father, an educational psychologist and expert chess teacher, who strongly believed that geniuses were made and not born. At age 15 she became the youngest chess grandmaster in history, is currently the only female chess player in the top 100, and is considered the strongest female chess player in history <sup><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judit_Polg%C3%A1r#Grandmaster'>3</a></sup>. In her own words, her success can largely be attributed to her refusal to play in women-only tournaments, preferring instead to play in the male-dominated ones against grandmaster-level opponents. By having no preconceptions of her own abilities based on her gender and refusing to be segregated, she was able to clearly demonstrate the lack of any such link between gender and chess ability.</p>

						<p>Similar examples of stereotype threat can be found in male-dominated industries, particularly IT - women are vastly outnumbered by men both educationally and professionally in this industry. The latter is particularly interesting, since during the development of the first computers, programming was typically dominated by women <sup><a href='http://womensenews.org/story/books/120323/women-were-first-computer-programmers#.U70rE41dVB8'>4</a></sup>. However, in recent decades, computing has been dominated by males, countless stories of bullying and harassment, and a general feeling of hostility to anyone who doesn't fit the 'programmer stereotype'.</p>

						<p>Interestingly, the 'programmer stereotype' also seems to result in stereotype threat among programmers themselves: stereotypically seen (and portrayed in media) as socially awkward, unhygenic, sexist, arrogant and unwelcoming. I have met plenty of programmers who are none of the above, who are nonetheless ashamed of labeling themselves as programmers for fear of <em>becoming</em> a stereotype.</p>

						<p>More recently, there have been a growing number of efforts to decrease the gender gap in computing - Ada Initiative, for example, encourages women's participation in open source projects, as well as working with tech conference organizers to ensure safe and inviting environments for women.</p>

						<p>On a personal level, I know there is plenty that I can do to try and combat stereotype threat: identifying and calling out sexism or racism, or other behaviour that might lead to stereotype threat, educating others about stereotype threat <sup><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat#Mitigation'>5</a></sup>, educating others about the concept of fixed vs growth mindset, and generally doing my best to be a good mentor to others.</p>
