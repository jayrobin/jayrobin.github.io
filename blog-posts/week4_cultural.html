						<h4>The impact of programming bootcamps</h4>
						<p>This may seem like an odd choice of topic given that I am part-way through a programming bootcamp (or at least, in the prep phase), but it's one that I've been thinking a lot about recently and I believe it's going to be discussed a lot more ove the coming months due to the acquisition of Dev Bootcamp by the Kaplan, Inc.</p>

						<p>Upon first hearing about programming bootcamps, I was initially sceptical, largely in part due to some very unbelievable claims made about taking in students who had barely touched a computer and turning them into ~$80k/yr Junior Developers in a matter of weeks. However, I did a lot of research and found that many of the claims appeared to be both true and reasonable, for a few reasons:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>There is currently a shortfall in <em>good</em> tech talent</li>
							<li>The employment figures are usually for graduates within 3-12 months post-bootcamp</li>
							<li>Most bootcamps appear to have a reasonably high barrier to entry/completion, as well as intensive 'prep' work prior to the bootcamp</li>
						</ul>

						<p>From the individual, programming bootcamps are fantastic: they facilitate a transition into a very well paid skilled role at a fairly reasonable cost over the course of a few short months, but what about the impact on the tech industry as a whole?</p>

						<h4>Explosion of bootcamps</h4>
						<p>Dev Bootcamp takes perhaps an average of 20 students per cohort at $12,200 per student [<a href='http://devbootcamp.com/faq/'>1</a>], bringing in a new cohort every three weeks - these numbers paint the clear picture that programming bootcamps are a profitable business, so it is not in the least bit surprising that they have exploded in number both nationally and internationally [<a href='http://bootcamper.io/schools'>2</a>] over the past few years.</p>

						<p>Unfortunately with popularity there occasionally comes mediocrity - there are bound to spring up some less-than-reputable bootcamps with no regards to the quality of the course...</p>
						<iframe class='center' width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BRWvfMLl4ho" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p>Each poor quality bootcamp pumping out poor quality developers has a negative impact on the industry as a whole: since bootcamps represent a new and unique approach to teaching programming, there's currently no clear distinction between each one - to the press, industry and general population they are all just 'programming bootcamps'. Not only this, but for a potential bootcamp student there are few reliable places to look beyond a handful of limited comparison sites to get an idea of which bootcamp may be right for them.</p>

						<p>I believe that <em>some form</em> of regulation or certification may be necessary and beneficial to the progress and general acceptance of programming bootcamps, since (done the right way), this would enable that clear distinction between bootcamps that focus on quality of graduates and those that simply focus on quantity.</p>

						<h4>Saturation of junior developers</h4>
						<p>Another potential negative impact that has crossed my mind is the saturation of the market place with junior developers. Personally, I worry this could lead to something similar to the early 2000's outsourcing craze where offshore development teams were in a race to the bottom for price and therefore, salaries.</p>

						<p>Similarly, in the UK during the late 90's there was a push for 50% of young people to attend university - prior to this university graduates were highly sought after, but since the explosion in graduates in the last decade, they've now become a minimum requirement for all but the most basic of jobs. Coupled with the removal of grants and a ten-fold increase in tuition fees in little over a decade, students are being forced to begin their careers in huge amounts of debt with very bleak prospects.</p>

						<p>Obviously it's pure conjecture that anything similar could happen again as a result of programming bootcamps, but with dozens of bootcamps each graduating hundreds of new developers per year, surely there must exist a saturation point of junior developers?</p>

						<p>Regardless of what happens in the short term with acquisition of Dev Bootcamp and the potential requirement for bootcamp regulation in California, programming bootcamps are very likely to grow in number and popularity in the coming years. At the current growth rate, supply will eventually have to overtake demand, in terms of both demand for junior developers and demand for bootcamps - at this point either bootcamps will have to adapt, or the tech industry will.</p>
