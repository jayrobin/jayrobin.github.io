					<h3>Week One - Cultural blog</h3>
					<span class="article_content">
						<p class='date'>01 Jun 2014</p>
						<p>After watching <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's Fireside Chat</a> I feel I've got a much better understanding of both what I should expect from DBC, and what DBC expects of me. I particularly liked Shereef's Kitchen vs Restaurant analogy: DBC isn't like a restaurant where you pay for you meal, order somthing off the menu, consume it and then leave. It is more like a kitchen, where everyone is in it together customising and adapting the experience, learning as they go (both the teachers and the students).</p>
						<p>I believe this model fits well with my learning style: I've always had trouble getting any value from the standard university model of lectures+tests, instead learning far more from hacking away on my own and with others, getting continuous feedback as I go.</p>

						<p>My impression of DBC is that they truly want to help us become the best developers we can be in the time available, and that they admit that their model isn't perfect, but they're improving all the time. I still have some concerns about market saturation of developers and employers not taking bootcamp grads seriously due to the recent explosion in bootcamps (many of seemingly poor quality), but the video did assuage these fears somewhat.</p>

						<p>I'm both excited and nervous about DBC: excited about starting about starting a new chapter of my life and truly challenging myself, and nervous about starting a new career from scratch after moving half-way across the world.</p>

						<p>As a final thought, I'm unsure of what's expected of us with regards to remote pairing. I understand that we have a handful of guided pairing sessions with specific tasks to complete, but we're also expected to arrange a number of other pairing sessions to work on other tasks in the week. The issue I have is that, looking ahead, the majority of the work appears oriented towards solo activity, e.g. writing blog posts, reading and completing tutorials, working on your own GitHub pages site.</p>
