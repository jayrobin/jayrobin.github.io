						<h4>How does my Mind Style fit with DBC?</h4>
						<p>As part of the DBC pre-phase 0 prep work, we were required to take a test to determine our Gregorc Mind Style; mine came up firmly as Concrete Random. According to the Mind Style model, Concrete Random thinkers:
						<ul>
							<li>Are experimenters</li>
							<li>Take risks</li>
							<li>Rely on their intuition</li>
							<li>Prefer to solve problems independently</li>
							<li>Use trial-and-error</li>
							<li>Enjoy competition</li>
							<li>Dislike restrictions, formal reports, routines, repeating something they consider 'done', keeping records, showing how they got their answer, and choosing only one answer</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Reading down that list, I do feel like each of the bullets does fit me very well in terms of how I learn best. When it comes to coding, I love just diving headfirst into the code, trying to break things every step of the way just to see what happens. I have a lot of trouble in general with formality and authority ('do this because I say so' authority, i.e. when the rationale behind a task isn't communicated), which probably doesn't suit a PRINCE2 project manager too well!</p>

						<p>In the DBC experience so far, my struggles seem to correspond quite well with my mind style:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>(Dislike restrictions, formal reports, routines and choosing only one answer) I don't feel like I'm getting the most out of the required end-of-exercise reflections. They feel quite prescriptive, where as I think I'd prefer something a little more free flowing/stream-of-consciousness</li>
							<li>(Are experimenters, use trial-and-error) In the exercises I've been required to provide pseudocode, due to my experimentative nature I've found that my solution deviates considerably from my original plan. I'm always happy with the end result, but that's usually because I found a much better way to implement something mid-way through</li>
							<li>(Dislike repeating something they consider 'done') I'm certainly not one to shy away from refactoring, but for me it's usually part of the overall iterative cycle rather than a specific step I plan for. A couple of exercises have requested a solution immediately followed by a refactored solution, while so far refactored as I've gone and therefore find it pretty unnecessary to refactor any further</li>
						</ul>

						<p>However, since DBC is a <a href='week1_cultural_new.html'>kitchen rather than a restaurant experience</a>, I don't see why I can't adapt the process to better suit my Mind Style. There are a few strategies I'm considering implementing: </p>

						<ul>
							<li>Don't feel enforced by the suggested structure of the reflections. Write them as if you were writing them to yourself, in a manner that you would find most informative if you were reading it back later</li>

							<li>Use pseudocode as a way to consider the major components of a program, but don't feel constricted by it. Maybe either update the pseudocode as you go, or annotate areas that you felt it necessary to deviate from</li>

							<li>Thoroughly review code (or better yet, have someone else review it) after completing a solution. Don't feel bad if there's nothing to refactor, but take it as a challenge (competing against yourself!) to make it as beautiful and optimized as possible</li>
						</ul>

						<p>As well as this, I just plan to keep on with my overall strategy of experimenting: getting the phase 0 work done on time, but also deviating as much as possible to try and break, hack and discover.</p>
						<p>Most of all, I plan to keep an open mind about everything, especially my mind.</p>
